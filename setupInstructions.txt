When you select 'setup' from the main menu, you will be able to place spherical
particles by pressing the left mouse button. Each particle has its own
properties, which can be customised using the inputs on the right hand side of
the screen. All changes will take effect immediately, apart from the height off
of the ground, which will only take effect if and when you check the box
labelled 'Lock to height'. You can also press the 'S' key to resize the
particle, and use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

Naturally, each particle is of a certain material, which determines
both its colour and its density. In order to change the particle's material,
you can either select a material from the dropdown menu, or - if none of the
materials have your desired density - you can create your own material by
pressing the button labelled 'Create material'.

After you have placed any particles, if you decide that one of them doesn't
have the properties you want it to have, you can simply right click on it to
open an edit menu, in which you can change all of the properties you could
before it was placed, or even delete it.
